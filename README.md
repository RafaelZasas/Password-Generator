## What is this all about? üí¨
This is a small scale OSS project for `newbs` like me to practice
with and make something that might look cool on a resume üìù.<br>



## What you need to know:
- This app is written in Python 3.8. 
- Main purpose of this program \[currently\] is to act as a
 web integrated and mobile, random password generator. (Just for fun why not? üôà)
 An example can be found on my [website]
 
- I've chosen to use [`FastApi`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) as our API framework
  for the backend python functionality. but at some point Id like to make a [GraphQl](https://graphql.org/) version too. (Maybe someone can commit? üë•)

Please see the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)
guidelines before pushing to any branches on this repo.

### Usage:
- see [`FastApi`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for in depth 
api details.
- Ensure you have a *local virtual environment* setup and 
`pip install requirements`.
- navigate to the **src** folder and run the following command:
    - `uvicorn main:app --reload`
- This will start a locally hosted server at **[http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)**
- you can then make requests to the api by specifying a url with 
parameters if need be.
- To see what requests can be made navigate to the `/docs` page
where you will be greeted with the beautiful **swaggerUI**.
